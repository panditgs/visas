<h1>Why Canada is Best for Indian Professionals</h1>

<p>Canada is a beautiful country known for its booming economy, thriving job market and multicultural society. Moreover, the country has a great quality of life. </p>
<p>According to the latest report by US News & World Report, Canada claimed the first spot as the best country in the world. It also performed greatly in indicators like Cultural Influence, Entrepreneurship and Social Purpose. </p>
<p>Due to these factors, the country has become a favourable destination for foreigners to work and settle. The largest population of foreigners immigrating to the country at a rapid rate are Indians. </p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons why it is so appealing for Indians: </p>

<h2>Embraces Different Cultures</h2>
<p>Compared to European countries and the United States, which are considered melting pots, Canada is more of a mosaic or a mixed salad. </p>
<p>In the other countries, where different foreign cultures mix into the country’s culture, Canadian culture itself is formed by the cultures of the people who settle there. Toronto is the most diverse city and is often referred to as the world’s most multicultural city. </p>
<p>Therefore, while Indians had to become Americanized or Europized previously to fit in, they are now free to practice their customs and culture in Canada. </p>

<h2>Booming Economy</h2>
<p>Canada currently stands at the 9th position among the world’s largest economies with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 1,883 billion and a per capita income of $49,222. </p>
<p>While Canada is well-known for its wealth of natural resources, its economy is heavily service-oriented, with around 80% of Canadians working in a service-related job. </p>
<p>While the country’s goods-producing sector is relatively small, the manufacturing and oil and petroleum industries are experiencing little but stable growth annually over the last several years.    </p>

<h2>Thriving Tech Sector</h2>
<p>The information and technology sector is the fastest growing industry in Canada, with over 41,000 tech companies present across the country. This is why thousands of Indian techies flock to Canada every year, looking to work and settle in the country. </p>
<p>The Canadian government’s investment and support in the industry are very strong with grants and other similar tools. Canada is quickly rising as a destination of choice for employers seeking skilled tech professionals. </p>
<p>Toronto stands on the top with big names like Google Sidewalk Labs, Salesforce, Shopify, and Facebook setting offices in the city. Apart from Toronto, other cities are also establishing themselves as tech cities. </p>

<h2>World-Class Education System</h2>
<p>Canada spends more on education than other developing countries in the world. It is referred to as the most academic country in the world. </p>
<p>The country’s K12 public education system is considered one of the best in the world. It is also home to a number of the top-ranked universities in the world, like McGill University, the University of Toronto, McMaster University and British Columbia University. </p>
<p>With free education until high school, the immigrants can take their family with them when immigrating to the country and enroll them in Canadian schools. After high school, several universities are offering affordable <a href="https://www.kansaz.in/study-visa/canada">tuition costs in Canada for international students</a>.</p>

<h2>Universal Healthcare</h2>
<p>Canada has one of the best healthcare systems globally. Thanks to the healthcare programs available in the country, the country is among the top 20 countries globally in life expectancy rates at just below 82 years. </p>
<p>Under this system, every province or territory has a healthcare plan providing citizens and <a href="https://www.kansaz.in/top-destinations-canada">permanent residents</a> with reasonable access to medical care.
 Therefore, they do not have to pay for healthcare services like hospital visits or consultations with doctors. </p>
<p>However, not this program does not cover healthcare services like dental care, eye care, ambulance service, prescription/over-the-counter medicine and long-term care. </p>
